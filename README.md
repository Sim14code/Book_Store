# Online Book Store

Welcome to the **Online Book Store** repository! This project is a comprehensive web application designed to provide an exceptional online shopping experience for book lovers. It is developed using Django and ReactJS, with modern features ensuring a smooth and secure user journey.

## Project Highlights

### 1. **Backend Framework: Django**
- The server-side logic and database management are powered by Django.
- RESTful APIs were developed to facilitate efficient communication between the backend and frontend components.

### 2. **Frontend Framework: ReactJS**
- A dynamic and user-friendly interface was created using ReactJS.
- Features real-time updates and interactive designs to enhance the browsing and shopping experience.

### 3. **Real-time Comments Rendering**
- Users can post and view comments in real-time, ensuring an engaging interaction without needing page reloads.

### 4. **Secure Payment Gateway: Razorpay**
- Razorpay integration enables secure and reliable transactions.
- The payment process is straightforward, prioritizing user convenience and safety.

### 5. **Authentication via Google**
- Google Authentication was implemented to offer a quick and secure login option.
